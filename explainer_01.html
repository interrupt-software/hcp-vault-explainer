<h2>Secrets injection with Lambda Extension</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The extension is configured via Lambda environment variables. Most of the Vault CLI client's environment
        variables are available, as well as some additional variables to configure auth, which secret(s) to read and
        where to write secrets.
    </li>
    <li>
        An event triggers the instantiation of an AWS Lambda function. Upon bootstrap, the Vault AWS Lambda Extension
        makes a request to obtain secrets from a Vault deployment.
    </li>
    <li>
        The extension writes the secrets to a private location that is accessible in the Lambda Execution
        Environment and then signals for readiness.
    </li>
</ul>
